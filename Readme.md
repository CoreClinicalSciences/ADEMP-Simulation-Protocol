# ADEMP Preregistration
This repository contains the ADEMP preregistration (ADEMP-PreReg) template introduced in Siepe et al. (2023) ADD LINK. This preprint also contains general recommendations for simulation studies. 
ADEMP-PreReg is a general-purpose preregistration template for Monte Carlo simulation studies which was developed for psychology, but can be used for other quantitative disciplines as well. 

## How to use it?
There are multiple options to use the ADEMP-PreReg template:

1. Use the Google Docs version at URL
2. Use the .docx version in this repository (NAME)
3. Use the LaTeX version in this repository (NAME)

After filling out your preferred version of the template, you can upload and timestamp your preregistration at the service of your choice, for example at the (Open Science Framework)[https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration] or (Zenodo)[https://zenodo.org/].  
A brief example of a full protocol using ADEMP Pre-Reg can be found in the folder `/example/`. We will add further examples to this repository after researchers have used the template.
