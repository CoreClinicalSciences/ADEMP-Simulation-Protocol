# ADEMP Preregistration
This repository contains the ADEMP preregistration (ADEMP-PreReg) template introduced in Siepe et al. (2023) ADD LINK. This preprint also contains general recommendations for simulation studies. 
ADEMP-PreReg is a general-purpose preregistration template for Monte Carlo simulation studies which was developed for psychology, but can be used for other quantitative disciplines as well. 

## How to use it?
There are multiple options to use the ADEMP-PreReg template:

1. Use the Google Docs version [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHWHkzMwDmrmllTQjBzt9soscxoEH2QXj0cibqZM7og/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Use the .docx version in this repository (`ADEMP-PreReg.docx`)
3. Use the LaTeX version in this repository (`ADEMP-PreReg.tex`). We are currently also submitting the `.tex` file as an Overleaf template for easier use. 

After filling out your preferred version of the template, you can upload and timestamp your preregistration at the service of your choice, for example, at the [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
When using the Open Science Framework, you may, for example, upload the template as part of the open-ended OSF registration (see [here](https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/)). 

## Gallery 
A brief example of a full protocol using ADEMP-PreReg is included in the template itself. We will add further examples to this repository after researchers have used the template.

## Feedback
We hope to continuously improve the template and invite interested researchers to suggest improvements to the template. Please feel free to open an Issue or a Pull Request in this repository to voice any questions, criticism, or feedback on the template. If you do not wish to do that, you can also contact us at bjoernsiepe@gmail.com.

To modify the template and open a Pull Request, please modify the `ADEMP-PreReg.tex` file. This file can then be converted to `ADEMP-PreReg.docx` by running `make docx` (requires pandoc).
